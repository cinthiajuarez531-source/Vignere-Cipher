# Vignere-Cipher
This project implements the Vigenère Cipher, a polyalphabetic cipher that encrypts and decrypts messages using a repeating keyword. It demonstrates concepts from discrete structures such as modular arithmetic, loops, and functions.
# Programming Approaches
- Modular arithmetic for letter shifts
- Loops to process each character
- Functions to organize code
- Character-to-number mapping for encryption/decryption
